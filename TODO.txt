CONSIDER SENDING ALL OF THIS IN THE SAME CHANNEL THE COMMAND WAS ACTIVATED AND DELETING ALL THE MESSAGES (THIS WILL LEAD TO NOTIFICATIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT ONLY WHEN A NEW THREAD IS ADDED)

BREAK UP THE MONOLITH OF A FILE INTO OTHER "HEADER" FILES WITH ALL THE HELPER FUNCTIONS IF THAT IS POSSIBLE

---- DONE (I think, it looks isolated based on coming back 10 months later) ---- REMOVE ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AND THEIR FILES. CREATE FOLDER AND TRANSFER UNUSED FILES TO THAT FOLDER IN A WAY THAT MIMICS THE DIRECTORY HIERARCHY THAT THEY USED TO BE IN

---- DONE ---- RELEASE CURRENT VERSION, SET UP DEV ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE MAKING CHANGES WITH THE BELOW (MAKE A PROD AND DEV BRANCH) 

SEARCH THREAD FOR THE MESSAGE THE BOT IS ABOUT TO POST, IF IT ALREADY EXISTS, DO NOT SEND THE MESSAGE AND NOTIFY THE USER

CONSIDER MAKING THE SPOILER-ARCHIVE A FORUM CHANNEL (THIS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE A LOT OF CODE CHANGES AND LIKELY A SCRIPT THAT CONVERTS THE EXISTING SPOILER-ARCHIVE INTO FORUM POSTS (START WITH THIS))

HAVE IT MANAGE ROLES. ONE COMMAND ASKS USER TO SELECT A ROLE OR MAKE A ROLE (THE NAME OF THE BOOK THEY'RE READING). THEN WHEN USING THE OTHER COMMAND, IT WILL EITHER AUTO-POST TO THE USER'S ROLE'S BOOK 
THREAD OR NOT BOTHER MESSAGING THE USER IF THEIR ROLE IS SET. SUB-FUNCTIONALITY: HAVE THE BOT CHECK THE BOOK ROLES AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND DELETE THE ROLE IF NO ONE CURRENTLY HAS THAT ROLE.
