CONSIDER SENDING ALL OF THIS IN THE SAME CHANNEL THE COMMAND WAS ACTIVATED AND DELETING ALL THE MESSAGES (THIS WILL LEAD TO NOTIFICATIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT ONLY WHEN A NEW THREAD IS ADDED)

BREAK UP THE MONOLITH OF A FILE INTO OTHER "HEADER" FILES WITH ALL THE HELPER FUNCTIONS IF THAT IS POSSIBLE

---- DONE (I think, it looks isolated based on coming back 10 months later) ---- REMOVE ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AND THEIR FILES. CREATE FOLDER AND TRANSFER UNUSED FILES TO THAT FOLDER IN A WAY THAT MIMICS THE DIRECTORY HIERARCHY THAT THEY USED TO BE IN

---- DONE ---- RELEASE CURRENT VERSION, SET UP DEV ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE MAKING CHANGES WITH THE BELOW (MAKE A PROD AND DEV BRANCH) 

SEARCH THREAD FOR THE MESSAGE THE BOT IS ABOUT TO POST, IF IT ALREADY EXISTS, DO NOT SEND THE MESSAGE AND NOTIFY THE USER

CONSIDER MAKING THE SPOILER-ARCHIVE A FORUM CHANNEL (THIS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE A LOT OF CODE CHANGES AND LIKELY A SCRIPT THAT CONVERTS THE EXISTING SPOILER-ARCHIVE INTO FORUM POSTS (START WITH THIS))

HAVE IT MANAGE ROLES. ONE COMMAND ASKS USER TO SELECT A ROLE OR MAKE A ROLE (THE NAME OF THE BOOK THEY'RE READING). THEN WHEN USING THE OTHER COMMAND, IT WILL EITHER AUTO-POST TO THE USER'S ROLE'S BOOK 
THREAD OR NOT BOTHER MESSAGING THE USER IF THEIR ROLE IS SET. SUB-FUNCTIONALITY: HAVE THE BOT CHECK THE BOOK ROLES AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND DELETE THE ROLE IF NO ONE CURRENTLY HAS THAT ROLE.

remove the book name before the colon if it matches the name of the thread

better formatting (coloring and proper username capitalization) for the thread posts

Look into better role management (ie it looks like you can set roles to bot managable, so you could potentially make all the roles you don't want the bot to mess with 
just not bot editable and make sure the new roles you make are bot editable)

Consider updating the spoiler archiver to simply get the list of roles the user has instead of all the threads in the Spoiler channel. AND, maybe a way to toggle this is to make the button for that menu say "Get All Threads"
and then that server you a context menu with all the threads

ALSO MAKE THE SET AND REMOVE ROLE COMMANDS SLASH COMMANDS

MAKE "ADD ROLE" PRESENT A LIST OF OPTIONS THAT INCLUDE ALL THE THREADS, AND ALSO PRESENT A BUTTON THAT ALLOWS USER TO TYPE IN THEIR ANSWER

COULD MAKE THE LIST OF THREADS TO POST TO JUST THE BOOK ROLES THAT THE USER HAS ASSIGNED TO IT. (THOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE THIS TOGGLEABLE IN GENERAL SOME HOW SO IT CAN BE TOGGLED ON A SERVER TO SERVER BASIS)

Add the non-book roles array to the .dotenv file somehow and pull the data from there. Mimic this for the heroku deployment.
IF YOU TRY TO MAKE THE NON-BOOK ROLES AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, INSTEAD SEE IF YOU CAN JUST PULL THE ROLES THAT ARE MADE BY THE BOT. AND HAVE THE BOT ONLY WORK WITH ROLES ITS CREATED. So if someone made a book role for some reason,
that would be improper use of the bot. You have to create roles with the "set role" function
