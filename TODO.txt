DELETE ALL MESSAGES FROM THE BOT AFTER THEY ARE SENT (CONSIDER KEEPING ERROR MESSAGES AND THE FINAL ARCHIVED MESSAGE)

CONVERT THE NEW THREAD FEATURE TO A BUTTON

CONSIDER SENDING ALL OF THIS IN THE SAME CHANNEL THE COMMAND WAS ACTIVATED AND DELETING ALL THE MESSAGES (THIS WILL LEAD TO NOTIFICATIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT ONLY WHEN A NEW THREAD IS ADDED)

COMMENT ALL THE CODE 

BREAK UP THE MONOLITH OF A FILE INTO OTHER "HEADER" FILES WITH ALL THE HELPER FUNCTIONS IF THAT IS POSSIBLE

REMOVE ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AND THEIR FILES. CREATE FOLDER AND TRANSFER UNUSED FILES TO THAT FOLDER IN A WAY THAT MIMICS THE DIRECTORY HIERARCHY THAT THEY USED TO BE IN

ADD CHECK IF A THREAD ALREADY EXISTS WHEN CREATING A NEW THREAD, IF IT DOES, JUST SEND THE MESSAGE THERE
