ADD A CREATE FOR THE SPOILER-ARCHIVE CHANNEL IF IT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST

CONSIDER SENDING ALL OF THIS IN THE SAME CHANNEL THE COMMAND WAS ACTIVATED AND DELETING ALL THE MESSAGES (THIS WILL LEAD TO NOTIFICATIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT ONLY WHEN A NEW THREAD IS ADDED)

BREAK UP THE MONOLITH OF A FILE INTO OTHER "HEADER" FILES WITH ALL THE HELPER FUNCTIONS IF THAT IS POSSIBLE

REMOVE ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AND THEIR FILES. CREATE FOLDER AND TRANSFER UNUSED FILES TO THAT FOLDER IN A WAY THAT MIMICS THE DIRECTORY HIERARCHY THAT THEY USED TO BE IN
